## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### FullStack Application Developer
#### Seeking an 18-month apprenticeship

##### Who Am I?
Initial background in metrology
After earning a Technical University Diploma in Physical Measurements, I specialized in metrology through a professional bachelor's degree, following a 10-week internship completed in 2017. I continued with a work-study program until my hiring at the end of 2018. Initially interested in this field, I performed various stimulating tasks requiring reflection and analysis, particularly measurement uncertainty calculations. However, these rewarding assignments gradually became scarce, giving way to increasingly repetitive tasks. I then realized that this profession no longer aligned with my professional aspirations.

##### Discovery and interest in development
In 2022, I began learning programming in my personal time, quickly developing an interest for it and seeing an opportunity for greater fulfillment. Meanwhile, at work, whenever I had time, I looked for improvements that could benefit the company while allowing me to get closer to development.

Thus, I progressively self-taught myself the creation and deployment of Power BI reports, notably using DAX and Power Query M languages. These skills brought notable improvements to my department and, with my abilities being recognized, I was requested to develop and maintain reports for another department. Although these projects presented genuine interest for me, they constituted only a small part of my activities, reinforcing my desire for career change.

##### Transition to development
From May to July 2024, I undertook a professional retraining process through the PTP program of Transition Pro Normandie, which allowed me to follow a 10-week bootcamp provided by Le Reacteur.

In accordance with the program, I resumed my position as a metrology technician after the training. Having no other means to complete my career transition, I made the decision to resign in March 2025, after 7 years of experience in metrology. Since then, I have been dedicating my time to improving my developer skills and actively preparing for the apprenticeship training offered by Le Reacteur, for which I am currently seeking a host company.
